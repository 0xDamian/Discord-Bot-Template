# Discord-Bot-Template
This is a template for a Discord bot written in Python (discord.py v2). It is also an Open-source version of DAMNSEC Discord bot.

Creating Discord bots can be really nice projects for beginners, that said, this is simply a template. 
You can read the code and see how it works (Updates to this template will be made).


You can get it on your system by simply cloning it:

`$ git clone https://github.com/0xDamian/Discord-Bot-Template.git`

# Requirements
`Python >= 3.8`

`Discord.py`
```
# Linux/macOS
python3 -m pip install -U discord.py

# Windows
py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py
```

As for me, I installed this in a virtual environment. If you want to install it globally, sure. E no concern me actually.
But if you want to do what I did (This is assuming you have `virtualenv` installed.):


```
$ cd Discord-Bot-Template

# Create Virtual Environment
~/Discord-Bot-Template $ virtualenv -p python3 discord-py

# Activate Virtual Environment
~/Discord-Bot-Template $ source discord-py/bin/activate

# Install Discord.py in Virtual Environment
(discord-py) ~/Discord-Bot-Template $ python3 -m pip install -U discord.py
```
